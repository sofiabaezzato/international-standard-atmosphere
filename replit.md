# Interactive Atmosphere Model Learning Tool

## Overview

This project is an **educational platform** for learning about atmospheric modeling, combining scientific accuracy with interactive exploration. It implements the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model and compares it with simplified exponential models, teaching users about the trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy.

The tool provides:
- **Accurate ISA calculations** using the 8-layer atmospheric model (ISO 2533:1975 standard)
- **Exponential atmosphere models** with optimizable scale height (β) parameter
- **Interactive optimization** to find best-fit β for any altitude range
- **Visual learning tools** including 2D error heatmaps and comparison plots
- **Educational tutorials** explaining atmospheric physics and mathematical optimization

Perfect for students, educators, and engineers learning about atmospheric modeling!

## User Preferences

## System Architecture

### Modular Design Pattern
The application uses a **modular architecture** with separate components for calculation, optimization, and visualization:

**src/isa_calculator.py** - ISA atmosphere model
- Class-based static methods for stateless calculations
- 8-layer atmospheric model with proper layer selection
- Geometric ↔ Geopotential altitude conversion

**src/exponential_models.py** - Exponential atmosphere models
- Simple exponential model: P(h) = P₀ × e^(-h/β)
- Configurable scale height (β) parameter
- Error calculation vs ISA model

**src/optimizer.py** - Scale height optimization
- Least-squares optimization using scipy
- Finds optimal β for any altitude range
- Detailed analysis and comparison reports

**src/visualizer.py** - Interactive visualizations
- 2D error heatmaps (β vs altitude)
- Model comparison plots
- Beta sensitivity analysis

**main.py** - Educational interface
- Menu-driven interactive learning system
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Guided exploration modes

### Atmospheric Layer Model
The system implements a **multi-layer atmospheric model** with 8 distinct atmospheric regions:
- Each layer defined by: base geopotential altitude, base temperature, and temperature lapse rate
- Supports altitude range from sea level (0m) to upper mesosphere (86,000m)
- Layer selection algorithm efficiently determines which atmospheric region applies to a given altitude

### Altitude Conversion System
Implements bidirectional conversion between:
- **Geometric altitude**: Actual height above Earth's surface
- **Geopotential altitude**: Gravity-adjusted altitude used in ISA calculations

This dual-altitude system accounts for Earth's curvature and gravity variations, ensuring accuracy in high-altitude calculations.

### Calculation Engine
The `calculate_isa()` method serves as the primary computation interface:
- Accepts geopotential altitude as input
- Determines applicable atmospheric layer using efficient layer selection algorithm
- Applies appropriate thermodynamic equations based on layer characteristics (isothermal vs. gradient layers)
- Returns temperature, pressure, density, and speed of sound at the specified altitude

### Error Analysis Feature
The calculator includes a comprehensive error analysis system that compares:
- **Proper method**: Converting geometric to geopotential altitude before ISA calculations
- **Simplified method**: Using geometric altitude directly (common approximation)

Calculates percentage errors for all atmospheric parameters, demonstrating that:
- At sea level: errors are negligible (0%)
- At 10,000m: altitude difference ~16m (0.16% error)
- At 50,000m: altitude difference ~390m (0.78% error), pressure error ~4.8%

This feature helps users understand when geopotential conversion is critical for accuracy.

### Exponential Model & Optimization System

**What is Scale Height (β)?**
The scale height is the single parameter in the exponential atmosphere model that determines how quickly pressure and density decrease with altitude. The standard value is β = 8,000m, but this can be optimized for specific altitude ranges.

**Optimization Process:**
1. User selects altitude range (e.g., 0-20 km)
2. System generates ISA reference data for that range
3. Least-squares optimization finds β that minimizes: Σ(P_exponential - P_ISA)²
4. Results show optimal β, RMSE, and comparison with standard β = 8,000m

**Key Insights:**
- Low altitudes (0-15 km): Optimal β ≈ 7,400m (lower than standard)
- Mid altitudes (0-30 km): Optimal β ≈ 8,500m (close to standard)
- High altitudes (0-50 km): Optimal β ≈ 9,200m (higher than standard)

This demonstrates why no single exponential model can match the multi-layer ISA across all altitudes!
